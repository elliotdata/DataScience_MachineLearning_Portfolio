Review: london heathrow to dubai this was the first time i had flown in first class  on ba i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed bas first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isnt the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates we were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the ba fleet the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy it is nice they offer a male and female kit my wife was delighted with the contents the champagne that ba offer in first is superb i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne i have tasted choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker food was very tasty and well presented i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing i cant really fault any of it it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787 i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous attentive with out being overbearing witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need they were superb wifi was available but the page to connect didnt load up when i tried it i dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer this was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first whether i would choose it over club world would be on flight by flight basis you have to do it once though

Review: fantastic flight in club world with british airways from london gatwick to punta cana on time departure from gatwick on a 777200  its true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin but seats 2a and 2b were comfortable and functioning perfectly greeted by friendly mixedfleet crew and provided with champagne and amentiy kits before take off prompt lunch service after departure and a varied menu with excellent wine choices i enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty the delicious castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so i recommend ordering this promptly as this was a leisure flight all champagne did run out about 3 hours in for which the crew apologised sincerely but there was plenty of red and white wine available including an excellent chablis and medoc the club kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who were always willing to help plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour before landing bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly the entertainment system was great in club with a decent selection of new release films though the screen resolution could be better especially wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full we were kept well informed of the flight progress throughout by a cheery and personable first officer who navigated a meanlooking thunderstorm near landing with aplomb all in all this was a relaxing and luxurious way to begin our holiday and a great to example of ba at their best

Review: london to tel aviv arrived at heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy but check and security felt like it was 10pm very easy and quick process which included regular rather than fast track security as we didnt follow the signs properly we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor although they did later improve the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches soup and some dry cake this wasnt really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty drinks overall were good as always with british airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the one provided was really quite appalling in terms of seating there was enough for all the passengers in there and it was quite busy and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place although better variety in seating including some more comfortable chairs would be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges smiles are free and go a long way and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality eerily walking around slightly like a zombie seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice there arent really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well would make it easier on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very back of the cabin this meant that we basically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access these seats are fantastic when travelling with someone and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort privacy and access unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution selection and even the fact that some screens wont even stay in place and fold themselves away british airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft end of story even the thales system is showing its age now but this rockwell collins one makes vhs tapes look state of the art the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience food and drinks on board were actually quite good although the on board service was not the new club world one on this route yet overall it was a very enjoyable flight and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for money having said that i would have still considered it good value even if paying cash

Review: i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the 23rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldnt get home ive also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding im not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee  shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5 she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldnt do it as my results didnt go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive ive come to her 3 times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady ive ever met unfortunately i didnt catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i cant thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i dont know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i havent met them i dont know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in

Review: i travelled to hong kong with british airways from heathrow on a 777200 outbound and one of their new a380s on the way back both in world traveller it had been a long time since i had travelled with ba 18 years but it was one of my better flying experiences i didnt know what to expect this time round but the seats had plenty of leg room on the 777 on the way out i was annoyed as i was told to pull my window blind down as other people were sleeping although i had specifically asked for the window seat for a reason however the crew were great and asked if id like to look out of the window by the jump seat which i did for a good few hours not only that the crew called the flight crew and the copilot walked to the back of the plane to have a chat with me and gave me a map with all the points of interest highlighted with the times we would be above them airlines dont have to spend any money to truly satisfy passengers the seat on the 777 was quite comfortable and the ife had plenty of selection the food was good not dried out and it was tasty all the toilets were operational and were clean on the way back i was upstairs on the a380 the aircraft was extremely clean comfortable and the a380 was ever so quiet in all areas of the flight which really surprised me i really loved the seat locker next to my window seat which easily fitted the contents of my hand luggage food was good again and the crew were again amazing allowing me to visit the flight deck after the flight had safely arrived at heathrow toilets were clean and tody and all operational and the ife was good leg room was good the only thing i would say is that the ife does take up a lot of space under the seat meaning that hand luggage cannot really be stored there and it can get in the way of your feet

Review: mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr isnt too bad club passengers can use the aa admirals lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to bas club passengers only at this time of day lovely staff solid food  bar really pleasant we flew an older 787 with the old style club seats seated in the front cabin just 3 rows of club in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style once cutting edge layout there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seats but it obvioulsy works and we were happy getting these seats flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service was impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good as well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr has always been terrible but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all bags went through without secundary checks we had a lovely shower at the spa what a fabulous facility the south lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture what a mess food on offer was solid and so are the drinks our home stretch to amsterdam was pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made everyone feel special with excellent barcart service i love the doubleservings of drinks english tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and i really dont understand ba stuck to it through the years noone like the cucumber white bread things but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it

Review: london heathrow to dubai this was the first time i had flown in first class  on ba i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed bas first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it isnt the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates we were on a 777 which is probably one of the oldest in the ba fleet the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy it is nice they offer a male and female kit my wife was delighted with the contents the champagne that ba offer in first is superb i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probably the best champagne i have tasted choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker food was very tasty and well presented i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached baby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing i cant really fault any of it it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787 i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous attentive with out being overbearing witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need they were superb wifi was available but the page to connect didnt load up when i tried it i dint really pursue it to be honest as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer this was a great flight and i would wholly recommend that you try out first whether i would choose it over club world would be on flight by flight basis you have to do it once though

Review: fantastic flight in club world with british airways from london gatwick to punta cana on time departure from gatwick on a 777200  its true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin but seats 2a and 2b were comfortable and functioning perfectly greeted by friendly mixedfleet crew and provided with champagne and amentiy kits before take off prompt lunch service after departure and a varied menu with excellent wine choices i enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty the delicious castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so i recommend ordering this promptly as this was a leisure flight all champagne did run out about 3 hours in for which the crew apologised sincerely but there was plenty of red and white wine available including an excellent chablis and medoc the club kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who were always willing to help plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour before landing bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly the entertainment system was great in club with a decent selection of new release films though the screen resolution could be better especially wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full we were kept well informed of the flight progress throughout by a cheery and personable first officer who navigated a meanlooking thunderstorm near landing with aplomb all in all this was a relaxing and luxurious way to begin our holiday and a great to example of ba at their best

Review: i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the 23rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldnt get home ive also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding im not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out one employee  shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5 she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba checkin but unfortunately couldnt do it as my results didnt go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive ive come to her 3 times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came back to heathrow on 24th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady ive ever met unfortunately i didnt catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i cant thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i dont know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his phone to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i honestly do not know what would i do if i havent met them i dont know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no one in

Review: hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august on 2nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves on 3rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on 4th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th how come it would disappear on the 5th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you cant imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage thats how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip

Review: vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec 22nd we received an email on dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost 1000 from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to checkin 15 hours before take off we found that our van  lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional 7001000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about 1000 cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for 15 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out  the customer service person would take 1520 minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience  we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for

Review: verified review  gatwick to orlando return worst ever longhaul business class flight  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british airways have descended not the worlds favourite airline by far we have never liked bas business class club world seats since they changed over to the yinyang layout of 8 seats across the cabin the seat layout together with the poor service meant we can honestly say this was the worst ever longhaul business class flight we have experienced to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place unless you are sat in an aisle seat cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinksmeals which is just ridiculous true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head in order to get out of the centre seats rows e and f and the window seats you have to climb over another passengers feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile would really struggle to get out into the aisle for whatever reason you almost feel imprisoned in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly often from behind you so by the time you notice them they have gone we should not have to use a call button just to get basic service the return leg was a night flight the service overall was very poor the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap the service at breakfast was also poor the offerings were inconsistent my wife struggled just to get an orange juice on her side of the cabin whereas i at least got that but struggled to get a second cup of coffee the entertainment system was archaic very few recent film titles the small screen resolution was very poor this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to get a decent seat and service ba are only getting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or one of those dreadful business class seats you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service it will be marginally better than being seated at the back but that does not make it right we will probably never fly ba longhaul business class club world again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and reconfigure their seating

Review: verified review  i was scheduled to fly ba208 from miami to london on january 18th boarding and departure went normal but than close to takeoff the ordeal began captain announced a technical problem at approx 0915 pm and thats when the horror started overall we ended up sitting in the plane until 0100 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane any attempts to fix the fault failed we were given accomodation but that was a 45 mins drive from miami airport checkin took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers and the place was like a freezer was rebooked for a flight the next day but downgraded from premium economy to economy old tatty 747 very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile phone worst of all the delay of one day has forced me to add another night in london and cancel my connection to munich total additional expenses not counting the difference between premium economy which i paid for and economy was 500 including the gap between economy and premium economy probably 900 now this is where a service oriented company would have an opportunity to make a difference submitted my compensation claims incl proof for the above expenses as per protocol online  no confirmation followed up with a call had to wait approx 45 mins to talk to a human and was told that most expenses are not refundable but i would be compensated for the remaining no further confirmation email etc was paid a mere 50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for the expenses were 900 decided to do some research and it appears that under eu law airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than 3 hours my delay was 21 hours  absolutely atrocious customer service lousy product how on earth ba deserves 4 stars in beyond me

Review: hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air bb house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august on 2nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves on 3rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august they told us that they had already sent the found luggage to the island in marstal on 4th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other one by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the baggage for us we believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which bag was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th we phoned menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we couldnt find our luggage and the staff didnt explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th how come it would disappear on the 5th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you cant imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage thats how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip

Review: vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec 22nd we received an email on dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund he processed the cancellation 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost 1000 from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other arrangements will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard back from the manager as we logged in to checkin 15 hours before take off we found that our van  lhr flight was cancelled due to the bad weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional 7001000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about 1000 cancellation fee to get a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the phone for 15 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out  the customer service person would take 1520 minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience  we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for

Review: verified review  toulouse to london heathrow this airline will one day get its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier it has to be said no expense is spared on its branding while operating as a cheap and sleazy budget airline thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management i have bronze status with ba executive club have flown a dozen times over the past year both in business and in economy and am increasingly irritated with myself that i chose to collect points with this particular airline i was caught up in the it meltdown in may flying from rhodes to london and i was one of the lucky ones who doesnt remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days i had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled along with hundreds of other ba flights in may this incidentally ghastly tui replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight i booked that i lost my prepaid hotel booking at the airport which the airline refused to refund when i lodged a claim the airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight along with eu compensation after i sent a second email a month after my first claim as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me according to the customer agent their customer service is beyond atrocious i suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for ba failings all you get is bear with us were trying really hard lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability i am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to belfast and after two calls to their contact center based in india with a poor connection and amateur communication overall still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a canadian citizen without a uk id document the customer agents i spoke to gave me contradictory answers which in turn run contrary to the almost nonexistent information provided on their website on the flights i have booked which have actually taken place i have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in bdx when the plane lost its takeoff spot having waited for delayed passengers would they admit this was their fault nope it was all air traffic controls fault been held on the tarmac in tls for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane retrieved a used bottle of rancid baby milk from my club seat no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival as i mentioned i have been one of their luckier passengers

Review: verified review  amsterdam to cape town via gatwick on our 13 hour night flight i discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline spent 13 hours sitting upright while everyone around me was in a reclined position complained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when i returned home to amsterdam this is exactly what i did ba replied that it was unfortunate that i had a bad ecperience and offered me a gbp25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more what an insult its unfair that i paid the same price as the rest of the passengers thats unfair they do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matter very arrogant and not customer friendly at all i feel cheated british airways obviously does not value their customers a gbp25voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day but for a long overnight flight its an insult sent 2 emails but they have decided they dont want to communicate anymore

Review: probably the worst business class experience ive ever had on an airline just a few of the issues required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional 600 on a single leg lhrlax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a380s leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vielhr leg the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380 and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered online checkin in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of 2022 there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in basic contact information on the website  and did not upload any covid documentation  i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vielhr leg the shopbacom page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times  over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible one might say on the lhrlax leg there was no premeal beverage service and there were no midflight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the prelanding snack of a ploughmans lunch being downright disgusting  there was no beverage or bar setup in the galley areas  beverages available to passengers during the flight  as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water i wont comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380 as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not 6 2 long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my 6 2 height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery
